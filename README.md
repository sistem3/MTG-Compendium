Magic the Gathering - Compendium was designed as a simple and easy way to search the [Scryfall API](https://scryfall.com/) and organise decks and collections, please note this project is a work in progress. Currently it has mana colour filtering but next steps will be to add further filtering capabilities as well as a collection manager and deck builder system.
